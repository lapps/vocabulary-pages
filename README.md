# Generating the LAPPS Grid Vocabulary

This project contains the vocabulary definition (DSL) and templates used to generate the [LAPPS Grid vocabulary](http://vocab.lappsgrid.org) website as well as Java code for the [Discriminator](https://github.com/lapps/org.lappsgrid.discriminator) and [Vocabulary](https://github.com/lapps/org.lappsgrid.vocabulary) modules.

A Makefile is available to automate most of the tasks involved in generating a new vocabulary web site and related Java classes.
